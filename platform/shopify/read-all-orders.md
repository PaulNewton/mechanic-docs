# "Read all orders"

By default, Shopify only allows apps to access the last 60 days of order history. Users can choose to give Mechanic access to all orders, across the store's entire history, by enabling the "Read all orders" setting.

## Instructions

### 1. Open your Mechanic settings.

You'll find the link by scrolling down on the Mechanic homepage.
