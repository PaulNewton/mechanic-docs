## Slack community

Mechanic was made for working together. Our Slack workspace is where folx of all kinds compare notes and collaborate on Mechanic projects, and it's an excellent place to ask your questions. You are always invited. :\)

## Open-source task library

With hundreds of tasks to choose from, it's often easier to modify an existing task than to create a task from scratch. Our task library is on GitHub, making it easy to search its code all at once. We also actively accept community contributions; pull requests for new and updated tasks are invited!
