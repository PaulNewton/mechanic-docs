# Arrays and Hashes

Mechanic's Liquid additions include mutable arrays and hashes, via the`assign`tag. These additions provide access to the power of Ruby, which backs the Liquid template language.

To facilitate this, we introduce two new keyword literals:

* `hash`  – `{}` 
* `array`  – `[]` 

## Arrays

* You may assign within an array by index, using integer lookups.
* Assignment within arrays is always by value, not by reference.
