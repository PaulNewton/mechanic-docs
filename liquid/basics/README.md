# Basics

If you have worked with Shopify themes, you've worked with Liquid. If you are new to Liquid or need a refresher the next few sections will cover the basics of the language. 

### Topics Covered

* [Comments](comments.md)
* [Variables](variables.md)
* [Comparisons](comparison-operators.md)
* [Conditionals](conditional-statements.md)
* [Iteration](iteration.md)
* [Filters](basic-liquid-filters.md)
* [Whitepspace](whitespace.md)

In later sections, we cover our additions to the Liquid language. To make our lives more comfortable here, we've introduced several new Liquid tags: [action](https://docs.usemechanic.com/article/359-the-action-tag), [log](https://docs.usemechanic.com/article/320-the-log-tag), and [error](https://docs.usemechanic.com/article/319-the-error-tag). We've also enhanced [the assign tag](https://docs.usemechanic.com/article/357-the-assign-tag) to support creating arrays and hashes.
