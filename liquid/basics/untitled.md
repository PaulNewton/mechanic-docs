# Filters

We can change the output of a Liquid object by applying a filter. Filters are separated by a `|`. The full range of filters are covered in the [Shopify Liquid docs](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/abs/). We'll cover some important ones in this section, but make sure to check out the Liquid [full docs](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/abs/).

## Default filter
