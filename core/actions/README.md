# Actions

In Mechanic, an **action** is an instruction for performing work that has an effect. Actions are generated by [**tasks**](../tasks/), in response to [**events**](../events/). Each action has a [**type**](types/), specifying the class of operation to be performed, and **options**, providing specifics about what that operation will do.

Actions are defined by tasks using [**action objects**](../tasks/code/action-objects.md), which are simple JSON objects specifying an action's type and options. Action objects can be constructed using the [**action tag**](../../platform/liquid/tags/action.md).
