# Action types

An **action type** determines the class of operation to be performed. While actions may vary greatly, there are only a few action types:

| Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Cache](cache.md) | Performing operations on the store's Mechanic cache |
| [Echo](echo.md) | Debugging; displays the options that it is provided, with no side-effects |
| [Email](email.md) | Sending transactional email |
| [Event](event.md) | Generating custom user events |
| [Files](files.md) | Generating files of various types, storing them at a temporary Mechanic-provided URL |
| [HTTP](http.md) | Performing HTTP requests |
| [Shopify](shopify.md) | Sending requests to the Shopify Admin API, supporting both REST and GraphQL |
