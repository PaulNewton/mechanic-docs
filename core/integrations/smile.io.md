# Smile.io

Smile.io is not officially integrated with Mechanic. However, Smile.io has an API \([documentation](https://api-reference.smile.io/)\), which means that Mechanic can be used to perform Smile.io-related work, using the [HTTP](../actions/http.md) action.

Their API supports webhooks \([documentation](https://docs.smile.io/docs/integrate-your-product/build-a-smile-app/features-and-functionality/webhooks#creating-a-webhook)\), which means you can wire up notifications to be sent to Mechanic whenever customers are updated \(see [Webhooks](../../platform/webhooks.md)\).
