# Welcome

I'm glad you're here. :\) I'm Isaac, and I built Mechanic. My intent is to make Shopify automation better for everyone. We do this, here, in two parts: \(1\) by making it as easy and fast as possible for developers to create something that specifically addresses a merchant's need, and \(2\) by making the configuration/management piece as easy and fast as possible for merchants. Mechanic is very, very good at both parts.

From the ground up, Mechanic was built to be composable and reusable – and if we consider all that power to be "under the hood", the hood is _extraordinarily_ thin.

## What it does

1. A developer writes a few lines of Liquid code. Or, a merchant installs a task [from our library](https://usemechanic.com/).
2. The merchant configures the task using an auto-generated form – each element automatically feeding a data source in the task's code.
3. The Mechanic platform handles responding to events coming from Shopify, from incoming email, from webhooks, etc. Scaling, uptime, monitoring, all sorted.

To get an idea of what Mechanic's been used for, have a look at our task library, at [usemechanic.com](https://usemechanic.com/). The code for each task is published, and each one can be modified. Mechanic is a highly versatile and incredibly powerful way to handle your process needs.
