# Welcome!

I'm glad you're here. :\) I'm Isaac, and I built Mechanic. My intent is to make Shopify better for everyone. We do this, here, in two parts: \(1\) by making it as easy as possible for developers to solve merchant problems, and \(2\) by making it as easy as possible to use \(and re-use\) those solutions. Mechanic is very, very good at both.

Mechanic is a powerful platform, and I made it to empower everyone who uses it. You are invited. :\)
