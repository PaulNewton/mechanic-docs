## What is the Mechanic task library?

Our open-source task library contains 280+ ecommerce automation tasks that are ready to use out of the box or serve as excellent starting points for custom tasks.

## Contributing your work to the task library

You've created a custom task and you want to share it with the world! This brings us so much joy and it exemplifies what the Mechanic project and this community are all about. If you get stuck along the way, please hop into the [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/usemechanic/shared_invite/zt-cq84nrs7-ggYbYTbf~CrCjTg8nmHP2A), and we'll be glad to help.

We follow the same process most open-source projects do when it comes to code management and code contributions.  The bonus is that once you learn the process here, you'll be able to contribute to almost any other open-source project.

### The process

* You'll [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the task library [repository](https://github.com/lightward/mechanic-tasks).
  * Forking is taking a copy of our repository, so that you can make changes
* Make your changes in your forked repository
* Make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), which will trigger a review of your proposed changes and the merging of them into the main repository, making your task available to everyone using the app.
