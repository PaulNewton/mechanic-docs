# Introduction

A task is a Liquid template, which we refer to as a "script" \(see [Scripts](https://docs.usemechanic.com/article/413-scripts)\). When an event comes in, Mechanic uses the event data to render that script. Each task script is responsible for rendering JSON definitions of  _actions_, which will then be run.

Mechanic comes with 280+ tasks, already in our library. The Liquid code for each one is available online \(see [usemechanic.com](https://usemechanic.com/)\), and is open-sourced on GitHub \(see [lightward/mechanic-tasks](https://github.com/lightward/mechanic-tasks)\).
