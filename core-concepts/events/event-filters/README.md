# Event filters

For Mechanic accounts that experience a large volume of events that don't need to be processed, **event filters** may be used to programmatically determine whether the event should be processed, or discarded.

This is often useful during large data migration operations, for stores that have Mechanic task subscribing to related topics. \(For example: if a store has a task subscribing to shopify/customers/update, and the store's team is about to update hundreds of thousands of customers, they may wish to use Mechanic event filters to programmatically ignore all update events generated by the bulk update.\)

An event filter has two parts:

* A name
* A Liquid template, which must render either `true` or `false`, making this decision based on data in the `shop`, `event`, or `cache` variables

When an event is received, Mechanic begins by running any event filters that are present on your account. \(Order is not guaranteed.\) If an event filter renders `false`, Mechanic halts processing of that event entirely, preventing any tasks from running for that event. \(If no event filter renders `false`, processing continues normally.\)

Event filters are configured in the Mechanic account settings:
