# Third-party

## Judge.me

* **judgeme/review/created** Occurs when new Judge.me reviews are received. Requires enabling the Mechanic integration within Judge.me; see [Judge.me's integration announcement](https://blog.judge.me/blog/new-integration-mechanic-app).

## Additional apps

Mechanic invites third-party app developers to develop Mechanic integrations, making it easy for developers to use our services together. If you're an app developer interested in this, email [team@usemechanic.com](mailto:team@usemechanic.com).

{% hint style="info" %}
Third-party services can often be connected to Mechanic using [webhooks](../../../platform/webhooks.md).
