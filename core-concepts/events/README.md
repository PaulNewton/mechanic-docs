# Events

In Mechanic, an **event** represents anything that happens.

This could be an order being paid, or a customer record being created, or a fulfillment being delivered.

Events are fed into Mechanic by the responsible party â€“ for events that are about things in Shopify, for example, the events come to Mechanic from Shopify itself.
