# Can I re-send order confirmation emails with Mechanic?

As of this writing, Shopify doesn't have a simple API for re-sending order confirmation emails. \(If this is important to you, send an email to [support@shopify.com](mailto:support@shopify.com) and let the folks there know that this is affecting your business.\)

However, you can use Mechanic to trigger order-related emails on demand \([sample task](https://usemechanic.com/task/trigger-order-emails-with-a-tag)\), and you can re-use your email notifications from Shopify \([documentation](https://help.usemechanic.com/en/articles/3168408-migrating-templates-from-shopify-to-mechanic)\).
